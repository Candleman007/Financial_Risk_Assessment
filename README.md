## ⚙️ Application Workflow

1. User registers or logs in
2. User accesses dashboard
3. User enters financial details
4. System calculates financial risk
5. Risk result is displayed
6. Risk history is saved and shown in dashboard

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test cases documented
- Test plan and test report created

### Automated Testing
- Authentication tests
- Dashboard access tests
- Risk calculation tests

All automated tests pass successfully.
